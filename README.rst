Distributed Asynchronous Hyper-parameter Optimization
=====================================================

This package was written for distributed asynchronous (parallel) hyper-parameter
optimization of machine learning algorithms.  It can also be used as a framework
for Bayesian Optimization for general algorithm configuration.
